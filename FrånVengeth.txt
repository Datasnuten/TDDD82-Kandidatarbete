For the button:

OSMF:
DownloadManager class, this is how I communicate between the player
and OSMF. I use a static instance for this.

SMP:
chrome/assetID where I give an id to my new assets, the graphic for the button.
StrobeMediaPlayback I have added the instance to the download manager
to the class as a variable, so they can communicate.

smp/chrome/ControlBar decides what elements are added to the control
bar, so in the configure method I let the control bar widget add my
button as a child.

 smp/chrome/widget/JumpButton is where I've created my button, there
isn't much work to be done if you let it inherit from an existing
widget. The main thing you do is bind the "xFace" to a suiting asset,
such as upFace to your upFaceAssetID. And implement the logic in the
onMouseClick event, I just set a boolean in my older download manager,
not sure what the last version was.
