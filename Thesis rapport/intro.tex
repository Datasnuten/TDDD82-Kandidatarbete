\chapter{Introduction}
\label{cha:introduction}

Streaming has evolved and become more popular over last couple of years. Thousands upon thousands of different streams are being watched every day\footnote{Twitch statistics https://stats.twitchapps.com/, Fetched: 2016-04-01}, thus the demand for better and more ways to stream are longed for. If we could stream videos in different ways we can create a more interesting streaming environment, this can provide both better entertainment but also a better way to potentially improve observation in science and other areas more reliably. If a stream can provide the possibility for watching a video from different angles it can give people the option to observe and also enjoy something from different perspectives. This project focuses on accomplishing that, by creating a geo-based video player that uses HTTP-adaptive streaming (HAS) that can allow people to view a video from different angles and change between them seamlessly without any buffering delay or stuttering. By looking at an existing video streaming player and improve it to accomplish this task we show that it is something worth implementing in already existing media players.

In this project we design and develop a geo-based command-and-control video streaming player using geo-tags. In practice this means that a service in which you can choose between a set of recording streams of the same event, for example, but slightly different locations and angles. This would be a useful feature to have in any larger event where you would want to show the same scene from different locations and angles. The interface will be useful for both event-organizers that hire staff to make several different recordings of the same scene for simultaneous viewing, but could also be used by the public who volunteer to record the event live. One major thing that this also could be used for is during a disaster event or something similar. By helping the police, medical and the emergency service by allowing them to view a disaster scenario from angles that can help them in communication. To be able to see and interactive with how the situation is seen from different angles to give a better understanding of what needs to be done.

The application we provide is only going to be a proof-of-concept which means that we will only focus on the functionality of the video player. Factors like a pretty interface and usability on broader spectrum will be neglected. We will focus on making the application work for only one user to verify the functionality we want to accomplish. The number of video streams that we will be able to switch between will,for the purpose of testing, be limited to a few, but then expanded upon to support any reasonable number of streams. This is because we firstly want to make sure that it is possible to switch between video streams and not that it can be done over large numbers. The reason for this is that pre-buffering many videos can be difficult to accomplish with a large number of video streams. As long as we provide a way to do it the solution can be expanded upon.
