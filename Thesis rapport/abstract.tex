Being able to interact with video streams can be both fun, educational and provide help during disaster situations. However, to achieve the best user experience, the interaction must be seamless. Creating an interface for a media player that allows for users to view multiple video streams of the same event from different geographical positions and angles is a challenge that is tackled in this thesis. The thesis describes the system design and methods used to accomplish this kind of media player and explains how to achieve a seemingly good, and, to higher extent, enjoyable video streaming experience. An algorithm is developed for placing each video stream object on the interface's geographic-based map automatically. These objects are placed to ensure the relative positions of the objects compared to the real world. The end result of this project is a proof-of-concept media player which enables a user to see an overview over a geographical streaming area. By seeing each streams relative location to the point-of-interest the users are able to click on that stream and switch to it. While the resulting player is not yet seamless, the result of this project shows the command-and-control center as initially envisioned. Implementing seamless, uninterrupted, switching between the video streams is outside the scope of this thesis. Instead the work done here and the developed software code will allow for easy integration of more advanced prefetching algorithms in future and parallel works.
