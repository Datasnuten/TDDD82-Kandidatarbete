Interesting classes: 
Advertisementplugin -> osmf/advertisementplugin/src/org.osm.advertisementplugin/
HTTTPDownloadManager -> osmf/net/httpstreaming/

Advertisementplugin will we use for showing/streaming the URL video. 
We can hardcode that every geomapObject has a video (video[1],video[2]...).
When streaming we will start with a default video (e.g. video[2]) which downloads till it reaches it maxbuffer.
While that video doesn't buffer anymore we can start buffer the other videos during that downtime.
This is done in a roundrobin way, look at the code we got from Venget. This is done in the HTTPDownloadmanager (we add that roundrobin code in the switch that is there, which we adjust to work for us).
 

For using Advertisementplugin we need to make it static public to the all projects by allowing it in properties for the OSMF.
To be allowed to do an externalInterface callback (to avoid "Security Error # 2060") we need to add the filepath security trust in the flash player. (both for the SWF.file and the webserver that is used)

We need to have videos on the server and the SWF files also and add them to the adobe flash player allow filepath.
We also need to add the bin directory from the SMP and OSMF in the adobe flash player.
Recommended (from Vengeth) to use a flashmedia server which is a free server with 6 month trial.
