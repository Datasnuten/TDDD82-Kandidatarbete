Interesting classes: 
Advertisementplugin -> osmf/advertisementplugin/src/org.osm.advertisementplugin/
HTTTPDownloadManager -> osmf/net/httpstreaming/

Advertisementplugin will we use for showing/streaming the URL video. 
We can hardcode that every geomapObject has a video (video[1],video[2]...).
When streaming we will start with a default video (e.g. video[2]) which downloads till it reaches it maxbuffer.
While that video doesn't buffer anymore we can start buffer the other videos during that downtime.
This is done in a roundrobin way, look at the code we got from Venget. This is done in the HTTPDownloadmanager (we add that roundrobin code in the switch that is there, which we adjust to work for us).
